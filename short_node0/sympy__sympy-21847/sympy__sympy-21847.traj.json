When `total_degree` is True (which is the case when `max_degrees` is an integer), the function is only generating monomials where the maximum exponent of any single variable is at least `min_degree`. This is done by checking `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` which means it's only considering monomials where at least one variable has an exponent of at least `min_degree`.\n\nHowever, according to the documentation, it should be generating all monomials where the total degree (sum of all exponents) is between `min_degree` and `max_degree`.
