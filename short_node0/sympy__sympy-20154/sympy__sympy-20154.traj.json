The `partitions()` function is indeed reusing the same dictionary object for each partition, which leads to all entries in the list being identical. The correct behavior would be to yield a copy of the dictionary for each partition.\n\nLet me modify the `partitions()` function to fix this issue. I'll need to make a copy of the dictionary before yielding it.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '1806s/yield ms/yield ms.copy()/' /testbed/sympy/utilities/iterables.py\n```\n\nNow, let me also update the second yield statement in the function:\n\n```bash\nsed -i '1845s/yield sum/ms.copy()/' /testbed/sympy/utilities/iterables.py\n```\n\nLet me verify that my fix works by running the script again:\n\n```bash\ncd /testbed && python -c \"from sympy.utilities.iterables import partitions; print('Issue demonstration:'); part_list = list(partitions(4)); print(part_list); print('\\nCorrect behavior with copying:'); correct_list = [p.copy() for p in partitions(4)]; print(correct_list)\"\n```",
