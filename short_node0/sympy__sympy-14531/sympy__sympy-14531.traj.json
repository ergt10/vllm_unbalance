Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

Let the object print itself if it knows how.\n  2. Take the best fitting method defined in the printer.\n  3. As fall-back use the emptyPrinter method for the printer.\n\nWhich Method is Responsible for Printing?\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe whole printing process is started by calling ``.doprint(expr)`` on the printer\nwhich you want to use. This method looks for an appropriate method which can\nprint the given expression in the given style that the printer defines.\nWhile looking for the method, it follows these steps:\n\n1. **Let the object print itself if it knows how.**\n\n    The printer looks for a specific method in every object. The name of that method\n    depends on the specific printer and is defined under ``Printer.printmethod``.\n    For example, StrPrinter calls ``_sympystr`` and LatexPrinter calls ``_latex``.\n    Look at the documentation of the printer that you want to use.\n    The name of the method is specified there.\n\n    This was the original way of doing printing in sympy. Every class had\n    its own latex, mathml, str and repr methods, but it turned out that it\n    is hard to produce a high quality printer, if all the methods are spread\n    out that far. Therefore all printing code was combined into the different\n    printers, which works great for built-in sympy objects, but not that\n    good for user defined classes where it is inconvenient to patch the\n    printers.\n\n2. **Take the best fitting method defined in the printer.**\n\n    The printer loops through expr classes (class + its bases), and tries\n    to dispatch the work to ``_print_<EXPR_CLASS>``\n\n    e.g., suppose we have the following class hierarchy::\n\n            Basic\n            |\n            Atom\n            |\n            Number\n            |\n        Rational\n\n    then, for ``expr=Rational(...)``, the Printer will try\n    to call printer methods in the order as shown in the figure below::\n\n        p._print(expr)\n        |\n        |-- p._print_Rational(expr)\n        |\n        |-- p._print_Number(expr)\n        |\n        |-- p._print_Atom(expr)\n        |\n        `-- p._print_Basic(expr)\n\n    if ``._print_Rational`` method exists in the printer, then it is called,\n    and the result is returned back. Otherwise, the printer tries to call\n    ``._print_Number`` and so on.\n\n3. **As a fall-back use the emptyPrinter method for the printer.**\n\n    As fall-back ``self.emptyPrinter`` will be called with the expression. If\n    not defined in the Printer subclass this will be the same as ``str(expr)``.\n\nExample of Custom Printer\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n.. _printer_example:\n\nIn the example below, we have a printer which prints the derivative of a function\nin a shorter form.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from sympy import Symbol\n    from sympy.printing.latex import LatexPrinter, print_latex\n    from sympy.core.function import UndefinedFunction, Function\n\n\n    class MyLatexPrinter(LatexPrinter):\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Print derivative of a function of symbols in a shorter form.\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\n        def _print_Derivative(self, expr):\n            function, *vars = expr.args\n            if not isinstance(type(function), UndefinedFunction) or \\\\\n               not all(isinstance(i, Symbol) for i in vars):\n                return super()._print_Derivative(expr)\n\n            # If you want the printer to work correctly for nested\n            # expressions then use self._print() instead of str() or latex().\n            # See the example of nested modulo below in the custom printing\n            # method section.\n            return \"{}_{{{}}}\".format(\n                self._print(Symbol(function.func.__name__)),\n                            ''.join(self._print(i) for i in vars))\n\n\n    def print_my_latex(expr):\n        \\\"\\\"\\\" Most of the printers define their own wrappers for print().\n        These wrappers usually take printer settings.
