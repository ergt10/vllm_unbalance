We forked the migrate.py management command and modified it to accept a dictionary containing database connection parameters as the --database argument. \nThe dynamic database router is based on, and very similar to this: \u200bhttps://github.com/ambitioninc/django-dynamic-db-router/blob/master/dynamic_db_router/router.py\nThis has worked beautifully for all migrations up until this point.\nThe issue we're running into is that when attempting to run a migration which contains a call to migrations.RenameModel, and while specifying the database parameters to the migrate command, the migration fails with an OperationalError, stating that no such table: django_content_types exists.\nAfter having exhaustively stepped through the traceback, it appears that even though the content_type.save call is wrapped in the with transaction.atomic(using=db) context manager, the actual database operation is being attempted on the default database (which in our case does not exist) rather than the database specified via schema_editor.connection.alias (on line 15 of the same file) and thus fails loudly.\nSo, I believe that:\ncontent_type.save(update_fields={'model'})\nshould be\ncontent_type.save(using=db, update_fields={'model'})\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
