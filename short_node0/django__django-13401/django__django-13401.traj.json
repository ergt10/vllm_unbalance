I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
