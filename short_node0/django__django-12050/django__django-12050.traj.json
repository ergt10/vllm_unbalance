We identified the issue in the resolve_lookup_value method in django/db/models/sql/query.py, where it was always converting iterables to tuples.\n2. We created a script to reproduce the issue, showing that a list input was being converted to a tuple output.\n3. We fixed the issue by modifying the method to preserve the input type using type(value)(resolved_values) instead of always using tuple(resolved_values).\n4. We verified that our fix works for the basic case and tested various edge cases to ensure robustness.\n\nThe fix is general and consistent with the codebase because:\n1. It maintains the same behavior for non-iterable values\n2. It preserves the original type of the iterable (list or tuple)\n3. It follows Python's dynamic typing principles by using the input value's type constructor\n4. It's a minimal change that addresses the specific issue without introducing new behavior\n\nLet's submit our solution.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
