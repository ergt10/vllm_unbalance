You can find the full write up as well as reproducible test repository \u200bhttps://github.com/JonnyWaffles/djangoordermetabug. The bug occurs because the field is an OrderBy object, not a string, during get_order_dir. The linked stacktrace should make the issue obvious, but what I don't understand is why it only fails during test db setup, not during repl or script use. I wish I could help more and come up with a real solution. Hopefully, this is enough for someone wiser to find the culprit.\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
