Identified the issue in the ModelChoiceField.to_python() method where it was raising ValidationError without the value parameter.\n2. Fixed the issue by adding the params={'value': value} parameter to the ValidationError constructor.\n3. Verified that the fix is consistent with how ValidationError is used in other parts of the codebase, particularly in ModelMultipleChoiceField.\n\nThe fix ensures that when a ModelChoiceField encounters an invalid choice, it will include the value of the invalid choice in the error message, making it more informative and consistent with other field types.\n\nLet me submit the fix:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
