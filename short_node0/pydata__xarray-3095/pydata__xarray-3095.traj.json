Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\nCommands must be specified in a single bash code block:\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\nExample of a CORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n</example_response>\n\nExample of an INCORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n\nNow I'll read the file:\n\n```bash\ncat file.txt\n```\n</example_response>\n\nIf you need to run multiple commands, either:\n1. Combine them in one block using && or ||\n```bash\ncommand1 && command2 || echo \"Error occurred\"\n```\n\n2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.py\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n### Any other command you want to run\n```bash\nanything\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

When `deep=True` is used, it's casting unicode indices to object type. This is happening in the `PandasIndexAdapter.__array__` method when it calls `np.asarray(array.values, dtype=dtype)`.\n\nThe problem is in the `PandasIndexAdapter.__init__` method where it determines the dtype. For unicode strings, it's setting the dtype to object when it should preserve the unicode dtype.\n\nLet's create a script to reproduce the issue:\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > reproduce_issue.py\nimport xarray as xr\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a dataset with unicode string coordinates\nds = xr.Dataset(\n    coords={'x': ['foo'], 'y': ('x', ['bar'])},\n    data_vars={'z': ('x', ['baz'])})\n\nprint(\"Original dataset:\")\nprint(ds)\nprint(\"\\nOriginal dtype of x:\", ds.x.dtype)\n\n# Test shallow copy\nds_shallow = ds.copy()\nprint(\"\\nShallow copy:\")\nprint(ds_shallow)\nprint(\"Shallow copy dtype of x:\", ds_shallow.x.dtype)\n\n# Test deep copy\nds_deep = ds.copy(deep=True)\nprint(\"\\nDeep copy:\")\nprint(ds_deep)\nprint(\"Deep copy dtype of x:\", ds_deep.x.dtype)\n\n# Test DataArray copy\nda_copy = ds.z.copy()\nprint(\"\\nDataArray copy:\")\nprint(da_copy)\nprint(\"DataArray copy dtype of x:\", da_copy.x.dtype)\n\n# Test DataArray deep copy\nda_deep_copy = ds.z.copy(deep=True)\nprint(\"\\nDataArray deep copy:\")\nprint(da_deep_copy)\nprint(\"DataArray deep copy dtype of x:\", da_deep_copy.x.dtype)\nEOF\n```",

In the `PandasIndexAdapter.__init__` method, it's checking if the array's dtype is valid for numpy using `utils.is_valid_numpy_dtype(array.dtype)`. If it's not valid, it's setting the dtype to object. However, this is causing unicode string indices to be cast to object type when they should be preserved.\n\nThe issue is that the check for valid numpy dtype is too broad and is catching unicode string dtypes. We need to modify the `PandasIndexAdapter.__init__` method to preserve unicode string dtypes.\n\nLet's make the necessary changes:\n\n```bash\nsed -i '100,110s/elif not utils.is_valid_numpy_dtype(array.dtype):/elif array.dtype.kind == \"U\":/g' xarray/core/indexing.py\n```",
