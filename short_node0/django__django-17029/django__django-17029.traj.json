Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

After analyzing the codebase and the PR description, I understand the issue clearly now.\n\nThe problem is that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method in the `Apps` class is decorated with `@functools.cache`, which means its results are cached. However, when the app registry is modified (e.g., through `set_installed_apps`, `unset_installed_apps`, or `set_available_apps`), the cache of this method is not being cleared, which can lead to incorrect behavior.\n\nThe PR description suggests adding `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()` to the `clear_cache` method in the `Apps` class to ensure that the cache is cleared when the app registry is modified. This is consistent with how other cached methods in the class are handled.\n\nLet me make the necessary changes to fix this issue:\n\n```bash\nsed -i '390i\\        self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()' /testbed/django/apps/registry.py\n```\n</THOUROUGHLY_EXPLAINING_THE_ISSUE>",

After analyzing the codebase and the PR description, I understand the issue clearly now.\n\nThe problem is that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method in the `Apps` class is decorated with `@functools.cache`, which means its results are cached. However, when the app registry is modified (e.g., through `set_installed_apps`, `unset_installed_apps`, or `set_available_apps`), the cache of this method is not being cleared, which can lead to incorrect behavior.\n\nThe PR description suggests adding `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()` to the `clear_cache` method in the `Apps` class to ensure that the cache is cleared when the app registry is modified. This is consistent with how other cached methods in the class are handled.\n\nLet me make the necessary changes to fix this issue:\n\n```bash\nsed -i '390i\\        self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()' /testbed/django/apps/registry.py\n```\n</THOUROUGHLY_EXPLAINING_THE_ISSUE>",

After analyzing the codebase and the PR description, I understand the issue clearly now.\n\nThe problem is that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method in the `Apps` class is decorated with `@functools.cache`, which means its results are cached. However, when the app registry is modified (e.g., through `set_installed_apps`, `unset_installed_apps`, or `set_available_apps`), the cache of this method is not being cleared, which can lead to incorrect behavior.\n\nThe PR description suggests adding `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()` to the `clear_cache` method in the `Apps` class to ensure that the cache is cleared when the app registry is modified. This is consistent with how other cached methods in the class are handled.\n\nLet me make the necessary changes to fix this issue:\n\n```bash\nsed -i '390i\\        self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()' /testbed/django/apps/registry.py\n```\n</THOUROUGHLY_EXPLAINING_THE_ISSUE>",
