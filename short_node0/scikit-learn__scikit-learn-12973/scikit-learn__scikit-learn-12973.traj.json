Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

      "content": "<pr_description>\nConsider the following PR description:\nLassoLarsIC: unintuitive copy_X behaviour\nHi, I would like to report what seems to be a bug in the treatment of the `copy_X` parameter of the `LassoLarsIC` class. Because it's a simple bug, it's much easier to see in the code directly than in the execution, so I am not posting steps to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nAs you can see here, LassoLarsIC accepts a copy_X parameter.\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7389dbac82d362f296dc2746f10e43ffa1615660/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py#L1487\r\n\r\nHowever, it also takes a copy_X parameter a few lines below, in the definition of ```fit```.\r\n    ```def fit(self, X, y, copy_X=True):```\r\n\r\nNow there are two values (potentially contradicting each other) for copy_X and each one is used once. Therefore ```fit``` can have a mixed behaviour. Even worse, this can be completely invisible to the user, since copy_X has a default value of True. Let's assume that I'd like it to be False, and have set it to False in the initialization, `my_lasso = LassoLarsIC(copy_X=False)`. I then call ```my_lasso.fit(X, y)``` and my choice will be silently overwritten. \r\n\r\nIdeally I think that copy_X should be removed as an argument in ```fit```. No other estimator seems to have a duplication in class parameters and fit arguments (I've checked more than ten in the linear models module). However, this would break existing code. Therefore I propose that ```fit``` takes a default value of `None` and only overwrites the existing value if the user has explicitly passed it as an argument to ```fit```. I will submit a PR to that effect.\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
