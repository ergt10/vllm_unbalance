However, at this point, self.storage is already the evaluated version, so it wrongly returns false for a callable that returns default_storage.\n\nLet me create a script to reproduce the issue:\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > reproduce_issue.py\nfrom django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage, default_storage\nfrom django.db import models\nimport random\n\nother_storage = FileSystemStorage(location='/media/other')\ndef get_storage():\n    return random.choice([default_storage, other_storage])\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    my_file = models.FileField(storage=get_storage)\n\n# Print the deconstructed field to see if storage is included\nname, path, args, kwargs = MyModel._meta.get_field('my_file').deconstruct()\nprint(\"Deconstructed field:\")\nprint(f\"name: {name}\")\nprint(f\"path: {path}\")\nprint(f\"args: {args}\")\nprint(f\"kwargs: {kwargs}\")\nEOF\n```",

I identified the issue in the FileField's deconstruct method, where it was checking if self.storage is not default_storage to determine whether to add the storage kwarg. However, at this point, self.storage is already the evaluated version, so it wrongly returns false for a callable that returns default_storage.\n\n2. I fixed the issue by modifying the deconstruct method to check if hasattr(self, \"_storage_callable\") or self.storage is not default_storage. This ensures that the storage argument is included in the deconstructed form if it was originally a callable, regardless of whether it returns default_storage or not.\n\n3. I tested the fix with three edge cases:\n   - A callable that randomly returns either default_storage or a custom storage\n   - A callable that always returns default_storage\n   - A callable that always returns a custom storage\n   - A direct storage instance (not a callable)\n\nAll tests passed, showing that the fix works correctly in all cases.\n\nNow, let me submit the fix:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
