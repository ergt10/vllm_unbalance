It is also documented that custom forms for the User model need to define this method: \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/customizing/#a-full-example\nA while ago the forms.Field base class gained the \u200bdisabled argument to:\n[disable] a form field using the disabled HTML attribute so that it won\u2019t be editable by users. Even if a user tampers with the field\u2019s value submitted to the server, it will be ignored in favor of the value from the form\u2019s initial data.\nIt seems to me that this property could be set to True be default on the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField used to display the password hash.
