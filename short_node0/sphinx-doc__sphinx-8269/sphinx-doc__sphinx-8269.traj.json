The problem is in the `check_uri` function where it tries to check for anchors but doesn't properly handle HTTP errors.

I wrapped the anchor checking code in a try-except block to catch HTTP errors\n2. Before checking for the anchor, I now call `response.raise_for_status()` to raise an exception for HTTP error codes (4xx, 5xx)\n3. If an HTTP error occurs, I immediately return the error status instead of trying to check for the anchor\n\nNow let's test if this fixes the issue:\n\n```bash\ncd /tmp/reproduce && make clean && make linkcheck\n```",
