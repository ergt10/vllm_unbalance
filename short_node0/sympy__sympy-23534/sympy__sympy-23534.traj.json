The problem is that when we use a tuple of strings like `('q:2', 'u:2')`, the function creates `Symbol` objects instead of `Function` objects, even though we specified `cls=smp.Function`. And when we use a tuple containing tuples like `(('q:2',), ('u:2',))`, it creates tuples instead of the expected `Function` objects.\n\nLet's look at the implementation of the `symbols` function more carefully to identify where the issue is:\n\n```bash\ncd /testbed && grep -A 200 \"def symbols\" sympy/core/symbol.py | grep -B 20 -A 20 \"else:\"\n```",

If the character is a digit\n    then all contiguous digits to the left are taken as the nonnegative\n    starting value (or 0 if there is no digit left of the colon) and all\n    contiguous digits to the right are taken as 1 greater than the ending\n    value::\n\n        >>> symbols('x:10')\n        (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9)\n\n        >>> symbols('x5:10')\n        (x5, x6, x7, x8, x9)\n        >>> symbols('x5(:2)')\n        (x50, x51)\n\n        >>> symbols('x5:10,y:5')\n        (x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, y0, y1, y2, y3, y4)\n\n        >>> symbols(('x5:10', 'y:5'))\n        ((x5, x6, x7, x8, x9), (y0, y1, y2, y3, y4))\n\n    If the character to the right of the colon is a letter, then the single\n    letter to the left (or 'a' if there is none) is taken as the start\n    and all characters in the lexicographic range *through* the letter to\n    the right are used as the range::\n\n        >>> symbols('x:z')\n        (x, y, z)\n        >>> symbols('x:c')  # null range\n        ()\n        >>> symbols('x(:c)')\n        (xa, xb, xc)\n\n        >>> symbols(':c')\n        (a, b, c)\n\n        >>> symbols('a:d, x:z')\n        (a, b, c, d, x, y, z)\n\n        >>> symbols(('a:d', 'x:z'))\n        ((a, b, c, d), (x, y, z))\n\n    Multiple ranges are supported; contiguous numerical ranges should be\n    separated by parentheses to disambiguate the ending number of one\n    range from the starting number of the next::\n\n        >>> symbols('x:2(1:3)')\n        (x01, x02, x11, x12)\n        >>> symbols(':3:2')  # parsing is from left to right\n        (00, 01, 10, 11, 20, 21)\n\n    Only one pair of parentheses surrounding ranges are removed, so to\n    include parentheses around ranges, double them. And to include spaces,\n    commas, or colons, escape them with a backslash::\n\n        >>> symbols('x((a:b))')\n        (x(a), x(b))\n        >>> symbols(r'x(:1\\,:2)')  # or r'x((:1)\\,(:2))'\n        (x(0,0), x(0,1))\n\n    All newly created symbols have assumptions set according to ``args``::\n\n        >>> a = symbols('a', integer=True)\n        >>> a.is_integer\n        True\n\n        >>> x, y, z = symbols('x,y,z', real=True)\n        >>> x.is_real and y.is_real and z.is_real\n        True\n\n    Despite its name, :func:`symbols` can create symbol-like objects like\n    instances of Function or Wild classes.

When the input is a tuple of strings like `('q:2', 'u:2')`, it correctly identifies it as a sequence and processes each string separately. However, when the input is a tuple containing tuples like `(('q:2',), ('u:2',))`, it recursively calls `symbols` for each element in the outer tuple, but it doesn't pass the `cls` parameter to the recursive calls.\n\nLet's fix the issue by modifying the `symbols` function to pass the `cls` parameter to the recursive calls:\n\n```bash\ncd /testbed && sed -i '300s/cls=/cls=cls, /' sympy/core/symbol.py\n```",
