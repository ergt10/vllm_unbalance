This means any version >9 is not allowed for any check of something >1. That is, treated as string '0.6' > '0.10', but treated as versions '0.6' < '0.10'. Since Sphinx does the former, some extension versions may not be allowed when they should be.\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\r\n$ cd mplcursors\r\n$ pip install -r .doc-requirements.txt\r\n$ pip install -e .\r\n$ make -C doc html\r\n```\r\nThis passes just fine, because the requirements pin sphinx-gallery to 0.9. But if you then update to the current 0.10 release:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install sphinx-gallery==0.10\r\n$ make -C doc html\r\n```\r\nresults in a failure due to a \"not new enough\" version:\r\n```\r\nRunning Sphinx v4.1.2\r\nloading translations [en]... done\r\nmaking output directory... done\r\n\r\nSphinx version error:\r\nThis project needs the extension sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery at least in version 0.6.0 and therefore cannot be built with the loaded version (0.10.0).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nsphinx-gallery 0.10.0 should be accepted if 0.6 is the minimum specified.\r\n\r\n### Your project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### OS\r\n\r\nFedora\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n3.9.6\r\n\r\n### Sphinx version\r\n\r\n4.1.2\r\n\r\n### Sphinx extensions\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Extra tools\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
