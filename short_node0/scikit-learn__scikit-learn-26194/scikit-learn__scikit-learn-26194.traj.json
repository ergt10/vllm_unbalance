A non-regression test (that could be part of `sklearn/metrics/tests/test_ranking.py`) could be as follow:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_roc_curve_with_probablity_estimates():\r\n    rng = np.random.RandomState(42)\r\n    y_true = rng.randint(0, 2, size=10)\r\n    y_score = rng.rand(10)\r\n    _, _, thresholds = roc_curve(y_true, y_score)\r\n    assert np.logical_or(thresholds <= 1, thresholds >= 0).all()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is due to the following:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/e886ce4e1444c61b865e7839c9cff5464ee20ace/sklearn/metrics/_ranking.py#L1086\r\n\r\nBasically, this is to add a point for `fpr=0` and `tpr=0`. However, the `+ 1` rule does not make sense in the case `y_score` is a probability estimate.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what would be the best fix here. A potential workaround would be to check `thresholds.max() <= 1` in which case we should clip `thresholds` to not be above 1.\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.

We identified the issue in the `roc_curve` function where it was adding a threshold value of `thresholds[0] + 1` without checking if the original scores were probability estimates.\n\n2. We implemented a fix that checks if all the original scores are between 0 and 1 by checking if `thresholds.max() <= 1`. If they are, we clip the thresholds to not exceed 1. Otherwise, we maintain the original behavior.\n\n3. We verified that our fix works correctly for:\n   - Probability estimates (scores between 0 and 1)\n   - Non-probability estimates (scores that can exceed 1)\n   - Binary scores (0 or 1)\n\nThe fix is general and consistent with the codebase, as it maintains the original behavior for non-probability estimates while ensuring that thresholds don't exceed 1 when they should be probability estimates.\n\nLet's submit our solution:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
