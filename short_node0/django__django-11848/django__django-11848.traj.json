      "content": "THOUGHT: Now I understand the issue. According to the PR description, the current implementation has a hardcoded rule for interpreting two-digit years:\n- Years 0-69 are interpreted as 2000-2069\n- Years 70-99 are interpreted as 1970-1999\n\nHowever, according to RFC 7231, the correct interpretation should be based on the current year, with dates more than 50 years in the future being interpreted as dates in the past. Let's create a script to reproduce the issue and verify our understanding.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > test_parse_http_date.py\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\nimport calendar\n\n# Test with different two-digit years\ndef test_year_interpretation():\n    # Get current year\n    current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year\n    \n    # Test years around the current year\n    test_years = [current_year - 51, current_year - 50, current_year - 49, \n                  current_year - 1, current_year, current_year + 1,\n                  current_year + 49, current_year + 50, current_year + 51]\n    \n    # Format test dates in RFC850 format (which uses two-digit years)\n    for year in test_years:\n        # Convert year to two-digit format\n        two_digit_year = year % 100\n        \n        # Create a date string with the two-digit year\n        date_str = f\"Monday, 01-Jan-{two_digit_year} 00:00:00 GMT\"\n        \n        # Parse the date\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_str)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n        \n        print(f\"Input year: {year}, Two-digit year: {two_digit_year}, Parsed year: {parsed_year}\")\n        \n        # Check if the interpretation follows the RFC 7231 rule\n        expected_year = year\n        if parsed_year != expected_year:\n            print(f\"  MISMATCH: Expected {expected_year}, got {parsed_year}\")\n\n# Test with extreme values\ndef test_extreme_years():\n    # Test with year 0\n    date_str = \"Monday, 01-Jan-00 00:00:00 GMT\"\n    parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_str)\n    parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n    print(f\"Input year: 00, Parsed year: {parsed_year}\")\n    \n    # Test with year 99\n    date_str = \"Monday, 01-Jan-99 00:00:00 GMT\"\n    parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_str)\n    parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n    print(f\"Input year: 99, Parsed year: {parsed_year}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"Testing year interpretation relative to current year:\")\n    test_year_interpretation()\n    print(\"\\nTesting extreme years:\")\n    test_extreme_years()\nEOF\n```\n\nLet's run the test script to see how the current implementation behaves:\n\n```bash\ncd /testbed && python test_parse_http_date.py\n```",
