If this iterable is shorter than\n    the number of contour levels it will be repeated as necessary.\n\nhatches : list[str], optional\n    *Only applies to* `.contourf`.\n\n    A list of cross hatch patterns to use on the filled areas.\n    If None, no hatching will be added to the contour.\n    Hatching is supported in the PostScript, PDF, SVG and Agg\n    backends only.\n\nalgorithm : {'mpl2005', 'mpl2014', 'serial', 'threaded'}, optional\n    Which contouring algorithm to use to calculate the contour lines and\n    polygons. The algorithms are implemented in\n    `ContourPy <https://github.com/contourpy/contourpy>`_, consult the\n    `ContourPy documentation <https://contourpy.readthedocs.io>`_ for\n    further information.\n\n    The default is taken from :rc:`contour.algorithm`.\n\nclip_path : `~matplotlib.patches.Patch` or `.Path` or `.TransformedPath`\n    Set the clip path.  See `~matplotlib.artist.Artist.set_clip_path`.\n\n    .. versionadded:: 3.8\n\ndata : indexable object, optional\n    DATA_PARAMETER_PLACEHOLDER\n\nNotes\n-----\n1. `.contourf` differs from the MATLAB version in that it does not draw\n   the polygon edges. To draw edges, add line contours with calls to\n   `.contour`.\n\n2. `.contourf` fills intervals that are closed at the top; that is, for\n   boundaries *z1* and *z2*, the filled region is::\n\n      z1 < Z <= z2\n\n   except for the lowest interval, which is closed on both sides (i.e.\n   it includes the lowest value).\n\n3. `.contour` and `.contourf` use a `marching squares\n   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares>`_ algorithm to\n   compute contour locations.  More information can be found in\n   `ContourPy documentation <https://contourpy.readthedocs.io>`_.\n\"\"\" % _docstring.interpd.params)\n</output>"
