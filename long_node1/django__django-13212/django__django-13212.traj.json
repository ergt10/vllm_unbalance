Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

The PR description suggests that we should modify the validators to include the provided value in the ValidationError, so that custom error messages can use a %(value)s placeholder.\n\nLooking at the code, I can see that the EmailValidator's __call__ method is raising ValidationError without including the value being validated. This is consistent with other validators in the file.\n\nLet's modify the EmailValidator class to include the value in the ValidationError:\n\n```bash\nsed -i '170,175s/raise ValidationError(self.message, code=self.code)/raise ValidationError(self.message, code=self.code, params={\"value\": value})/' django/core/validators.py\n```\n\nThis command modifies the EmailValidator.__call__ method to include the value in the params dictionary with the key \"value\".
