The code attempts to return True to indicate success or failure acquiring a lock, but instead it always returns False. The reason is that cpython fcntl module returns None if successful, and raises an OSError to indicate failure (see \u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/fcntl.html#fcntl.flock).\nAnyone interested in using the non-blocking (i.e. locks.LOCKS_NB) requires a valid return value to know if they have successfully acquired the lock.\nI believe the correct implementation should be the following:\ndiff --git a/django/core/files/locks.py b/django/core/files/locks.py\nindex c46b00b905..4938347ea7 100644\n--- a/django/core/files/locks.py\n+++ b/django/core/files/locks.py\n@@ -107,9 +107,15 @@ else:\n\t\t\t return True\n\t else:\n\t\t def lock(f, flags):\n-\t\t\tret = fcntl.flock(_fd(f), flags)\n-\t\t\treturn ret == 0\n+\t\t\ttry:\n+\t\t\t\tfcntl.flock(_fd(f), flags)\n+\t\t\t\treturn True\n+\t\t\texcept OSError:\n+\t\t\t\treturn False\n\t\t def unlock(f):\n-\t\t\tret = fcntl.flock(_fd(f), fcntl.LOCK_UN)\n-\t\t\treturn ret == 0\n+\t\t\ttry:\n+\t\t\t\tfcntl.flock(_fd(f), fcntl.LOCK_UN)\n+\t\t\t\treturn True\n+\t\t\texcept OSError:\n+\t\t\t\treturn False\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
