The error occurs in Python's compile.c file at line 3559 in the compiler_nameop function. The assertion checks that the name being compiled is not \"None\", \"True\", or \"False\".\n\nThis suggests we're dealing with a special case handling for Python's built-in constants. The crash happens because someone is trying to compile the string \"False\" directly, which shouldn't be allowed in a name operation context.\n\nLet's first look at the current directory structure to find the relevant files:\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n</format_example>",

But when someone tries to compile just the string \"False\", it goes through the `not_expr` function which creates an `ast.Name(\"False\", ast.Load())` node instead of recognizing it as a constant.\n\nThis is causing the assertion failure in Python's compiler because it's trying to treat \"False\" as a variable name when it's actually a constant. We need to modify the code to handle \"False\", \"True\", and \"None\" as special cases in the `not_expr` function.\n\nLet's create a script to reproduce the issue:\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > reproduce.py\nfrom _pytest.mark.expression import Expression\n\n# This should crash the interpreter on a debug build\nExpression.compile(\"False\")\nEOF\n```\n</format_example>",
