Adding a vector to a zero scalar multiple of a vector\n4. Properly rejects adding a vector to a non-vector type\n5. Adding a vector to an empty vector\n\nLet's summarize the changes we made:\n1. We modified the `_check_vector` function to accept 0 as a valid argument, in addition to Vector instances.\n2. We restored the commented out check for `other == 0` in the `__add__` method.\n\nThese changes allow the `sum([N.x, (0 * N.x)])` operation to work correctly, as the zero scalar multiple is simplified to 0, which is now accepted by the `_check_vector` function.\n\nLet's submit our solution:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
