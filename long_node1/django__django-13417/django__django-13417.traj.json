When a QuerySet has `annotate()` with a GROUP BY operation, the default ordering from the model's Meta class is ignored.\n2. The `ordered` property in QuerySet doesn't correctly reflect this behavior.\n3. The problem is in the `ordered` property implementation in `django/db/models/query.py`.\n\nThe current implementation checks:\n- If it's an EmptyQuerySet (always ordered)\n- If there's any explicit ordering via `order_by` or `extra_order_by`\n- If `default_ordering` is True and the model has an ordering defined in Meta\n\nHowever, when we have a GROUP BY query (which happens with `annotate()`), the default ordering is cleared if the query isn't using slicing, distinct fields, or select_for_update. This is done in the `add_annotation` method in `query.py`.\n\nLet's create a script to reproduce the issue:\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > reproduce_issue.py\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport django\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models import Count\n\n# Set up Django environment\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'settings')\ndjango.setup()\n\n# Define a simple model with ordering in Meta\nclass Foo(models.Model):\n    uuid = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    \n    class Meta:\n        ordering = ['name']\n\n# Create a simple QuerySet\nqs = Foo.objects.all()\nprint(\"Original QuerySet:\")\nprint(f\"SQL: {str(qs.query)}\")\nprint(f\"ordered: {qs.ordered}\")\nprint(f\"default_ordering: {qs.query.default_ordering}\")\n\n# Create a QuerySet with annotate\nqs2 = Foo.objects.annotate(Count(\"pk\"))\nprint(\"\\nAnnotated QuerySet:\")\nprint(f\"SQL: {str(qs2.query)}\")\nprint(f\"ordered: {qs2.ordered}\")\nprint(f\"default_ordering: {qs2.query.default_ordering}\")\nprint(f\"group_by: {qs2.query.group_by}\")\n\n# The issue is that qs2.ordered is True even though the SQL query won't have an ORDER BY clause\n# because of the GROUP BY operation and the lack of explicit ordering\nEOF\n```\n\nLet me create a minimal settings file for our test:\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > settings.py\nimport os\nimport django\n\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n\nSECRET_KEY = 'fake-key'\n\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n]\n\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),\n    }\n}\n\ndjango.setup()\nEOF\n```",
